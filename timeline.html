                            I took a long weekend with a group of friends to experience west coast snow for the first time! We rented a rustic wood burning cabin near Leavenworth, a American town with the facade of a Bavarian village. We got two days of skiing in; the first one was sunny with nice groomed runs, and the second was blizzard conditions with deep powder. The trip was a lot of fun, however digging my car out after a full day of skiing was not so much fun.

                            While back in Colorado I made sure to get the most out of the snow! As it was early in the season there was just enough snow for my favorite runs to be open. The lack of snow didn't stop me from getting 4 days of skiing in! I started to learn how to carve like a pro and learned how cold it can get at 14,000 feet. Man, that was a cold day!

                            I have always heard great things about Seattle and as I had never been; I thought it was time to take a visit. With my best friends currently residing in the city I made it a point to see what they had all been up to! We visited the aquarium, a Sounders game, and had a great sky line tour of the city over a pint in the Columbia Center. Seattle lived up to all that people had made it out to be! Maybe I should move here some-day...

We ended up visiting; Colorado National Monument, Arches National Park, Canyonlands National Park, Dinosaur National Monument, Yellowstone National Park, and a small part of Arapaho & Roosevelt National Forest. The trip was a blast and something I would do again in a heartbeat. Maybe I would bring a larger car next time.

When a neighbor invited me to join him on the mountain I thought I would be able to keep up! It turns out I was a little too ambitious and my neighbor's age didn't slow him down at all! I was being pushed to my limits on every run, but in the end I learned more that day than I had all the days prior!

I got to ski multiple days in Keystone learning all sorts of techniques and eventually went down my first blue run! It was a great trip - even if I was tricked into riding that first blue.

                            After skirting around skiing for most of my life a friend decided it was time for me to learn how to ski. They dragged me up the mountain, lent me some gear, and sent me down the mountain. Well more or less fall down the mountain because man, skiing is hard! After two days of bumps and bruises I was starting to enjoy skiing.

                            As part of my last semester at university I had to take a required course I had been delaying for far too long - Plant Sciences 101. To pass the course I would have to write a long paper on the medical or social impacts of a plant species. However, this project did not excite me one bit. So after a brief talk with the professor I ended up modeling the Neolithic Transition with his research team instead. The research was successful and I was saved by the horror of reading about plants for the whole semester.

                            As I had done a wide range of research for the department I was asked if I would like to represent the university in New Mexico at the Undergraduate mathematics Research Conference. The university sent five of us to give presentations and attend lectures from other universities. While the lectures were a hit, the highlight of the conference was the mathematics contest. The contest was a rush of brain power and adrenaline colliding to form a frantic group-solving session. With no prep and just the pens in our pockets, my team was able to finish before all the other teams. Well frankly, quite a bit ahead of the other teams which made it quite worrisome - had we missed problems or solved them incorrectly? Sweet relief came the following day we found out that we not only finished first, but got every question correct! This caused quite the controversy as we were the new university, beat the reigning champions of 5 years, and no other team came close.

                            As I have always enjoyed the outdoors and, feeling a bit adventurous at the time, I took up a friend's offer to go 4 wheeling in Moab. I had never been 4 wheeling before so I wasn't sure what I signed up for. To put it frankly, the shaking of the vehicle, crawling over once impassable obstacles, and the breathtaking scenery made for one of the best experiences of my life.

                            With a building passion for computational maths I started looking for different topics which may interest me. As patterns had always caught my interest, the thought of constructing sequences with no arithmetic sequences caught my attention. During this project I learned a lot about programming and eventually made a SAT Solver to traverse my tree of possible solutions. While I didn't make any major break-throughs during this project, I was able to verify some of the previous records!

                            While this was my second time attending this conference I still looked forward to it with the same gleam. We spent the first day touring the city, zoo, and surroundings. The following morning it was time to attend lectures and present. I was fortunate enough to present on de Bruijn sequences and attend the poster contest. While I didn't place high in the poster contest I was able to win a book from Springer. I learned a lot, made strong connections with peers, and look forward to attending another in the future.

                            While taking a graduate-level combinatorics course, I came across an interesting idea relating to graph theory. After talking to the professor about the idea, I started to pursue research in the area. While I did not make any breakthroughs in the field, I was able to find a generalized method to solve a wide range of existing problems. I later presented these ideas at multiple conferences and published a paper detailing the method.

                            This was the point in my math career I felt like I belonged to a community. Previously when conversing with others I felt the need to avoid math as a subject, or over simplify concepts. That all changed when I went to the Joint Mathematics Meeting (JMM) in Atlanta. Being at a conference full of people who shared the same passion as me was eye opening. I was exposed to so many varieties of mathematics and it gave me an appreciation of how much more I could learn.

                            After helping out CSU's Math Club for a few semesters I decided to step up and take a leadership position. As the club's membership was dwindling, I made it a focus to reinvent the club's image and audience. This wasn't going to be a club with monthly lectures and poor retention. While president I raised participation from 5 people a month to 30 people a week,  replaced lectures with interactive projects and activities, funded 25 students to attend national mathematics conferences, hosted 3 large department parties, and changed the image of the CSU mathematics department.

                            In search of some money to spend on hobbies I landed my first job. The act of finding it was possibly the easiest job search in my lifetime! I inquired with one of my professors about getting a job as a grader and offered me the position on the spot! I started out grading for differential equations but eventually took on grading for all sorts of courses.

With my wish to have a sea bearing adventure and my father's dream to return to the sea again we set off to BVI. Here I formed my own sea bearing stories, learned a dying mode of transportation, and had an experience of a lifetime with my father.
